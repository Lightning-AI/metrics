class WordInfoLost(Metric):
    r"""
    Word Information Lost (WordInfoLost_) is a metric of the performance of an automatic speech
    recognition system. This value indicates the percentage of words that were incorrectly predicted
    between a set of ground-truth sentences and a set of hypothesis sentences.
    The lower the value, the better the performance of the ASR system with a WordInfoLost of
    0 being a perfect score.
    Word Information Lost rate can then be computed as:

    .. math::
        wil = 1 - \frac{C}{N} + \frac{C}{P}

    where:

        - C is the number of correct words,
        - N is the number of words in the reference
        - P is the number of words in the prediction


    Args:
        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and return None if this is set to False.
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step.
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called. default: None (which selects the entire world)
        dist_sync_fn:
            Callback that performs the allgather operation on the metric state. When ``None``, DDP
            will be used to perform the allgather


    Examples:
        >>> predictions = ["this is the prediction", "there is an other sample"]
        >>> references = ["this is the reference", "there is another one"]
        >>> metric = WordInfoLost()
        >>> metric(predictions, references)
