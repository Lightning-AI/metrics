class SDR(Metric):
    r"""Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDR) [1,2,3]

    Forward accepts

    - ``preds``: shape ``[..., time]``
    - ``target``: shape ``[..., time]``

    Args:
        use_cg_iter:
            If provided, an iterative method is used to solve for the distortion
            filter coefficients instead of direct Gaussian elimination.
            This can speed up the computation of the metrics in case the filters
            are long. Using a value of 10 here has been shown to provide
            good accuracy in most cases and is sufficient when using this
            loss to train neural separation networks.
        filter_length:
            The length of the distortion filter allowed
        zero_mean:
            When set to True, the mean of all signals is subtracted prior to computation of the metrics
        load_diag:
            If provided, this small value is added to the diagonal coefficients of
            the system metrics when solving for the filter coefficients.
            This can help stabilize the metric in the case where some of the reference
            signals may sometimes be zero
        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and returns None if this is set to False.
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step.
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called.
        dist_sync_fn:
            Callback that performs the allgather operation on the metric state. When `None`, DDP
            will be used to perform the allgather.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If ``fast-bss-eval`` package is not installed

    Example:
        >>> from torchmetrics.audio import SDR
        >>> import torch
        >>> g = torch.manual_seed(1)
        >>> preds = torch.randn(8000)
        >>> target = torch.randn(8000)
        >>> sdr = SDR()
        >>> sdr(preds, target)
        tensor(-12.0589)
        >>> # use with pit
        >>> from torchmetrics.audio import PIT
        >>> from torchmetrics.functional.audio import sdr
        >>> preds = torch.randn(4, 2, 8000)  # [batch, spk, time]
        >>> target = torch.randn(4, 2, 8000)
        >>> pit = PIT(sdr, 'max')
        >>> pit(preds, target)
        tensor(-11.6051)

    .. note::
       1. when pytorch<1.8.0, numpy will be used to calculate this metric, which causes ``sdr`` to be
            non-differentiable and slower to calculate

       2. using this metrics requires you to have ``fast-bss-eval`` install. Either install as ``pip install
          torchmetrics[audio]`` or ``pip install fast-bss-eval``

       3. preds and target need to have the same dtype, otherwise target will be converted to preds' dtype
